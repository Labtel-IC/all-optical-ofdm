                %For accurately read the income signal is necessary more 
                %than just have the decision level, it is also needed to 
                %know where it occurs. For instance, if we decide to use 
                %just to take the decision level and measure the mean value 
                %across and a portion of the time period, which portion 
                %should we take? It would be logical to take the central 
                %portion, but the bit may be deformed in such way that the 
                %information gets concentrated out of the middle part, 
                %which means the symbol is not symmetric. The symmetry

                %point of symmetry, we have the X, Y coordinates for the

                %transmitted information without error... theoretically.
