%% main logic to adress data on excel files
%Those next following lines cost me 4 days to develop. Here is the main
%idea of how to get any number and convert it to Excel alpha numeric collum
%indexation. The idea is to change the base of the given number. Let us
%assum that the number given to be converted is 10 based which means it
%varies from 0 to 9 (ten numbers in total). Now the Brazilian alphabet,
%which is based on the Roman alphabet added the k Y W letters. It is
%composed of 26 different characters. Therefore it can be used as an number
%26 besed which means it varies from A to Z (26 numbers in total). The
%point here is to conver a number 10 based in another number 26 based. The
%main idea is to divide the given number, for example 824, by 26 while the
%quotient be greater than 1. The new number 26 based will be composed by
%the rest of the division, for instance:
%               824/26 = 31 with 18 of rest
%The quotient without the rest is again divided by 26:
%                31/26 = 1 with 5 of rest
%The quotient without the rest is again divided by 26:
%                 1/26 = 0 with 1 of rest
%Finally, the new number 26 based is then 1 5 18. But in 10 based number
%the number 1 can be writen as 01 or yet 00001. We for convention don't
%represent the number zero at left. But in the 26 based number (represented
%by letter) the 0 is A. Therefore if we wanted to represent 1 in 26 based
%number we needed to AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA...B. It would be needed infinit
%numbers As before the number 1 10 based with is number B in 26 based. For
%convinience one unity will be remove from each part of the new number for
%better representation. Thus, the new number 26 based will be 0 4 17.
%Therefore, when converted to the 26 based notation (Alphabetic) it will be
%AER. If you need to check if the convertion is correct you just need to
%solve the equation:
%   ((nth10based + 1)*26^(nth-1)+...(1th10based + 1)*26^(1-1))
%For instance let us take the number AER for exemple:
%A is 0, E is 4 and R is 17 thus:
% (0+1)*26^2  + (4+1)*26^1  +  (17+1)*26^0 = 676 + 130 + 18 = 824 !!!
%As we can see the convertion was succefull.
