%c  This function is responsible for implementing an all-optical FFT. It 
%c is possíble to create an FFT of any size. Albeit, one must understand 
%c it’s limitations such as the granularity problem.  This process takes on 
%c account angel from 0 to 180 degrees and this interval is divided by 2 to 
%c the power of N where N is the order of the FFT. For instance, if the 
%c user need to filter 32 carriers it will have an FFT process of order 5 
%c hence the interval will be 5.6250, therefore in practice to implement 
%c the MZI it needs to accurately create phase delays spaced of 5.6250. 
%c Another problem is, the carriers are shuffled by this FFT, and for a 
%c perfect FFT implementation, the exact phase delay must be added to the 
%c right signal at the right time. This function also returns a vector map 
%c that indicates where each carrier is, thus the user can use this vector 
%c to correctly extract the right carrier. The following illustration 
%c better demonstrates the output mapping vector for an FFT of order 5.

    %by given the time signal a time delay and a phase delay. Those two 
    %parameters will not affect the data. But when the input signal is 
    %divided half of it passes through a light path and it is not changed. 
    %The second half will pass through another light path and through the 
    %application of a voltage it is possible to delay the signal by 
    %changing material characteristics. As a result, the second signal will 
    %have time and phase differences from the other signal. When those two 
    %components combine again at the end to DI there will be constructive 
    %and destructive results in both signals. At the end, the DI outputs 
    %two signals where one carrier the even components of the sub-carries 
    %and the other carriers the odd components of the input signal. Thus, 
    %it was implemented the first step of the Optical FFT.
