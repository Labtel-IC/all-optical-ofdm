%c This function is responsible for implementing an Delay Interferometer 
%c (DI). There many ways that this device can be implemented such as MZM,
%c passive components and couples with diffe light paths. This script will
%c inplement a DI ussing 3dB couples with 2-input and 2-outputs. The delay
%c given will be implement by light paths with different lengths and the
%c phase delay will be achieve with a phase controler. This will be the
%c principal and only device used to implement an All Optica FFT. Aiming to
%c separate subcarriers from an OFDM signal and convert from serial to
%c paralel.

%% * Stage: 1 spliting the principal input signal
% Fristly it is needed to divide the signal in two given that by the length
% difference of the optical pahts and the phase delay btween them the
% signals will interfere with one another.
 % split
 % An 3dB coupler with 2 inputs and 2 outputs is used to slplit the input
 % signal.
 %The couples will output two signals that are a combination of E1 and E0.
 %As E0 = 0 the out put will be just the E1 signal slpit in two. The name 
 %notation E11 means the E1 signal at the arm 1 (uper arm) hence the 
 %notation name E12 means the E1 signal at the arm 2 (Lower arm).
E11 = ExpCoef.*(cos(CoupConst).*E1 + MutCoef*1j*sin(CoupConst).*E0);        
E12 = ExpCoef.*(cos(CoupConst).*E0 + MutCoef*1j*sin(CoupConst).*E1);       

%% * Stage: 2 Changing the signal at the lower arm
 %Dellay and change phase
  %Firstly it is taken in acont what means for the input signal a time 
  %delay by measuring the input time vector
% aux1 = E12(t<=TimDel);
% aux1 = E12(1:TimDel);
% f=time2freq(t);
  %Secondly the signal will be delayed by rotation its possition. That 
  %means a circular rith-shift will be performed. The number of possition 
  %to be deslocated will be given by the number of point that represent the 
  %delay based on the input time vector given as input. The time delay
  %time accuracy depends on the time vector accuracy.
% E12d = [E12(end-(length(aux1)-1):end) E12(1:end-(length(aux1)))];
E12d = ifft(fft(E12).*exp(-1j*2*pi*TimDel.*f));

  %In practice the phase delay will be perfomed by an phase controler. In
  %the simulation it will be done by multiplying the input signal by a
  %complex neperian exponential where the argument was received as an input
  %parameters.
  %The nema notation means that the E12 was Delayed thus E12d
E12d = E12d.*exp(-1j*PhaDel);

%% * Stage: 3 Recombining both signals
 %Combining singnals
 %Similarly to te input step. An 3dB coupler with 2 inputs and 2 outputs is
 %used to combine the input signals from the arm1 and arm2. The couples 
 %will output two signals that are a combination of E12 and E12d.
 %Thus the Eout1 is the combination of E11 and E12d wich will be out put
 %at the port 1 of the couples. Hence, Eout2 is the combination of E11 and
 %E12d wich will be out put at the port 2.
Eout1 = ExpCoef.*(cos(CoupConst).*E11 + MutCoef*1j*sin(CoupConst).*E12d);
Eout2 = ExpCoef.*(cos(CoupConst).*E12d + MutCoef*1j*sin(CoupConst).*E11);
