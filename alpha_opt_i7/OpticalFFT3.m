%c This function is responsible for implementing an all optical FFT. Till
%c this present moment. It is possíble to create an FFT 16 of size. Wich
%c means, it can filter just 32 subcarriers. For furter implementation it is
%c need to correctly indentify the expansion function for the phase delay
%c parameters. The proble is, the carriers are shufled by this FFt, and for
%c a perfect FFT implementation the exacly phase delay must be added to the
%c right signal at the right time. The patern of randomization of the
%c carriers was not fully understood yet.

% There is were the magic of this sistme hapens. Basicaly saying, by given
% the tiem signal a time delay and a phase delay. Those two parameters will
% not afect the data. But when the input signal is devided half of it
% passes throug an light path and it is not changed. The second half will
% pass through anoter light path and applying an voltage it is possible to
% delay the signal by changing material characteristics. As as result the
% second signal will have time and phase differences from the other signal.
% When those to componentes combine again at the end to DI there will be
% construtive and destrutive results in both signals. At the end, the DI
% outputs two signals where one carriers the even componentes of the
% subcarries and the other carriers the odd components of the input signal.
% Thus, it was implemented the frist step of the Optical FFT
