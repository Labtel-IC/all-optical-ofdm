%%    Constants to controu the Optical FFT
% The optical FFT here implemented can take any number of carriers. The
% user must stay realistic because the number of actual devices used to
% implement this setup increases by the power of 2, thus higher orders of
% the FFT may not be feaseble to be implemented as the stability of each
% device may vary with temperature, aging and othter features.

%As result of the OFFT process the carriers get mingled at the output ports
%of this sistem. Thus, those vector were created as a map for the
%simulation. Where the possition of the vector is the output of the OFFT
%and the value within tha possition is the respective carrier filtered. The
%folloing ilustration better shows how each carrier get mingled in this
